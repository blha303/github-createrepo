github-createrepo
========

Uses the python module [github3](https://github.com/ChristopherMacGown/python-github3)

Tested on Python 2.7.3.

* Generate a github token with getgithubtoken. Put the token in createrepo where indicated.
* Make a template folder in your workspace, put a good .gitignore in there or something. Don't make a README.md, that's generated by newfolder.
* Put 'createrepo' in a location on the path (like /usr/bin/), then use "./newfolder ProjectName".
* It'll copy the template folder to ProjectName, initialize a git repository in that folder, make a README.md file with the ProjectName as the top heading, then commit and push to github.

Don't forget to change line 7 in newfolder to have YOUR github username, instead of mine.
